## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
Alternatively you may use yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```
OR
```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```
Alternatively you may use yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
