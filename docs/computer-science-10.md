title: Computer Science and Interview Prep
---

A comprehensive list including

- how to learn CS for free,
- how to learn algorithms with free courses,
- practice with competitive programming.

After learning all the stuff, you can apply for a job; so I needed to add **Interview resources** you can use for free and some **communities** you can join.
